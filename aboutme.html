                <text>For my family, we come from an all asian heritage. In my household, we have my mom, dad, and older brother named Justin. I'm the youngest and only daughter in my family. My mother gave birth to me on December 22 in the year of 2000. Here on the right, are my two favorite cousins! On the far left of me, is Evelyn and beside her is her half-sister, Jasmine. I have tens of cousins but these two ladies make me the happiest by far. Two other girls that make me very happy are my two dogs! Their names are Twinkie and Yoyo. Both of my dogs have been a large source of happiness for me and the rest of my famly. Speaking of the rest of my family, we don't necessarily do a lot together but we still acknowledge that we are there for each other. </text>

Here on the right, are some of my closest friends. I met them when I first came to Summit Shasta and we are still friends. Some background to the photo on the right is that it was my friend, Jordan's, birthday and we celebrated with ice cream cake. All of my friends, this day, displayed a big reason why I love them a lot. They're all so caring and positive, they keep my sanity in tact. Some other close friends that are not pictured in the photo are  Rachel, Jeannie, Kyle, and more. One cool fact is that Jeannie has been my one of my best friends since I was born because our parents have been long term friends as well. Unfortunately, she now lives in Denver and comes back a couple times a year to visit her dad and I. However in more positivity, I have several more friends that make me just happy as well.

                <text>One of my favorite hobbies is hanging out with my dogs. Once again, I have two dogs named Twinkie and Yoyo. Twinkie was born on the 28th of February 2013 and Yoyo was born on the 16th of February 2015. Yoyo sleeps in my room so I often get to play catch with her. Twinkie isn't necessarily the best catcher but she tries. My dogs are the highlight of going home after school or wherever I was during the day. On the right is a picture of Yoyo being held by my best friend, Rachel. There isn't much context as to what we were doing, but we were having a photoshoot with Yoyo because she's just that adorable.

                    One of my favorite genre of shows are comdeic cartoons. I have been watching them since I was a baby, but one of my favorite cartoon shows is Chowder. It had aired on Cartoon Network for only two seasons back around in 2010. Cartoon Network had been a large basis of all the cartoons that I would typically watch everyday. However as for movies, I love horror films. Personally, some of my favorite horrors have dolls and clowns which seem to scare the audience the most. My favorite movie by far is any of the Chucky movies. The background of the story is the most intriguing that I've seen. Although, I do not necessarily watch television or movies anymore.
