                <text>For my family, we come from an all asian heritage. In my household, we have my mom, dad, and older brother named Justin. I'm the youngest and only daughter in my family. My mother gave birth to me on December 22 in the year of 2000. Here on the right, are my two favorite cousins! On the far left of me, is Evelyn and beside her is her half-sister, Jasmine. I have tens of cousins but these two ladies make me the happiest by far. Two other girls that make me very happy are my two dogs! Their names are Twinkie and Yoyo. Both of my dogs have been a large source of happiness for me and the rest of my famly. Speaking of the rest of my family, we don't necessarily do a lot together but we still acknowledge that we are there for each other. </text>

Here on the right, are some of my closest friends. I met them when I first came to Summit Shasta and we are still friends. Some background to the photo on the right is that it was my friend, Jordan's, birthday and we celebrated with ice cream cake. All of my friends, this day, displayed a big reason why I love them a lot. They're all so caring and positive, they keep my sanity in tact.
