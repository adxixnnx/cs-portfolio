                 There is an overlooked importance that the society should know about every core piece of hardware that a computer is put together of. For every piece that is inputted into a computer, serves an impact that affects the final product of how a computer runs and processes its commands. Without any piece of hardware, every computer would not be the same. In the below boxes, each box will be discussing each major piece of hardware. Some examples of hardware that will be talked about are motherboard, Central Processing Unit (CPU), keyboard, etc. As you can tell, there will be certain pieces of hardware that you are familiar with and know that you use on a daily basis when on your computer. However, there are more in depth pieces that are inside your computer that not a lot of people notice and understand.

                A motherboard (sometimes called mobo) is a printed circit board that has other components that are interconnected to other circuit boards. The motherboard allows important pieces of the computer to communicate. For example, the motherboard allows the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory to understand what each other is trying to do in the computer.
