                 There is an overlooked importance that the society should know about every core piece of hardware that a computer is put together of. For every piece that is inputted into a computer, serves an impact that affects the final product of how a computer runs and processes its commands. Without any piece of hardware, every computer would not be the same. In the below boxes, each box will be discussing each major piece of hardware. Some examples of hardware that will be talked about are motherboard, Central Processing Unit (CPU), keyboard, etc. As you can tell, there will be certain pieces of hardware that you are familiar with and know that you use on a daily basis when on your computer. However, there are more in depth pieces that are inside your computer that not a lot of people notice and understand.

                A motherboard (sometimes called mobo) is a printed circit board that has other components that are interconnected to other circuit boards. The motherboard allows important pieces of the computer to communicate. For example, the motherboard allows the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory to understand what each other is trying to do in the computer. Another thing that the motherboard does, is provides connection to other peripherals. Peripherals are used to input information and get back the information from the computer.

                  The CPU is an electonic circuit that is controlled by instructions from a computer program. Instructions are carried out through the process of completing arithmetic, logical, control, and input/outpu operations that are given. From a historical standpoint, the CPU has been in the works since one of the early years in 1960. Throughout this time being, the CPU has developed far within its design and practice. In the containment of the CPU, is a intergrated circuit (IC). The IC holds storage memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components. Without the CPU, the computer would not be able to function because there would not be any piece of hardware that could transfer the commands into activation.

           One form of computer data storage is called the RAM. RAM is the abbreviated form of Random Access Memory. The RAM allows data to be read or written. With hard disks, CD-RWs, and DVD-RWs, the time to access the memory is dependent on physical location unlike the RAM. In the early 1970s, RAM chips were being put on the market and sold as something called the DRAM chip. In the early age of computers, they had used relays, mechanical counters, or delay lines for memory functions instead of the RAM. There are two types of RAM that are known as static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). SRAM is simply more expensive to produce because it is faster and uses less dynamic power. However, as for the DRAM,  stores a bit of data while using a transitor and capacitor pair-creating a DRAM memory cell.
