        <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's a language used to create webpages and web apps. HTML was used within the About Me Page, Hardware Page, etc. In HTML, consists of several different tags that are meant for different tasks. </li>
        <li>Tags are different elements used for placements and structuring of what goes into the final page. There's a large amount of different tags that can be used to help finalize your page. Below this, are tags I have used and what they are for</li>
        <li>The 'p' tag is intially meant for paragraph-hence, the letter chosen. </li>
        <li>The table tag is the element used to make tables. In the table tag, you can add multiple table rows, columns, etc.</li>
        <li>The 'td' in this tag, stands for 'table data.' Table data is what you put into the table-whether it's numbers, information, etc. It is different from the table tag because the table tag is just meant to tell the computer that you want the inputted information to be in a table format. </li>
        <li>The 'tr' in this tag stands for 'table rows.' Table rows are the different rows of a table, obviously. In rows, you can add more tags nested inside for headers or data. </li>
        <li>The 'div' tag is a large chunk of code that is given an ID and is used for Javascript and CSS.</li>
        <li>The 'br' tag stands for a line break that people want in their text for their web formatting. </li>
        <li>An id class is used as a selector for HTML elements. You have to name each id to whatever you want for the computer to know that it is encapsulated into one attribute. Once named, you can go to your CSS file and format the specific id to your liking.</li>
        <li>The body tag is essentially everything in your code, put together. Everything that is in your HTML that is shown, is what should be in between your beginning and ending body tag.</li>
        <li>The head tag is the tag that you use in HTML for headers. However, although a header is essentially a title, do not get the title tag mixed up with your header tag.</li>
        <li>Unlike the header tag, the title tag is used in HTML for naming your tab at the top of your screen. A header tag is used to be shown in your website-your title tag is used at the top to name the site.</li>

<center><h2>HOW TO: HARDWARE PAGE</h2></center>
    <center><p>Within the process of coding the Hardware Page, I had used about the same type of template where the coding was the same, but the wording and image sources were different. I had wanted a simple and easy to understand website where the audience (user) wouldn't have a hard time looking through a complex design. Below, I will be going through, step by step, on how the final product was coded and why I did so. Hopefully, the steps can bring a straightforward understanding rather than confusion.</p></center>
 </div>
<br><br>

   <center><p>This is a basis of what each chunk of hardware is coded as on the Hardware Page. Each chunk has a border, image of hardware, and information about what the hardware is. </p></center>

<ol>
    <li>Coding Borders</li>
    <p>Borders, in my case, were an important aspect in coding this page because I really wanted the page to be organized. I had figured that borders are separators for different chunks of information and would make it much simpler for users to differentiate. There are different styled borders that you can choose from. For example, the borders can be dashed, solid, dotted, and many more. </p>
    <li>Text Input</li>
    <p>For text input, I had used that with the 'p' tag in every text box that I used within the template of the Hardware Page. Once again, the p tag stands for paragraph. However, I put in the text into tables so that it would have a more organized format. Within the tables, I used table rows and table data tags so that images and the actual text would be separated onto different sides. </p>
    <li>Adding Images</li>
    <p>When explaining the pieces of hardware, it was found to be more effective and professional when having a picture alongside the information about it. To add an image, you just need to press 'Upload Local Files' in the 'File' tab. Then, you save the file to your cloud9. Next, you have to figure out where you want your picture to be located on your final product. Once that is done, you type in the image tag. The image that you would like to choose needs to be inputted into the image source's quotation mark so that the computer has a link to the picture and knows that that is the picture that you want to use. One key thing that you need to do is make sure that the ending of your image's link has .jpg or anything of that sort at the end. To move your image around-such as sizing or positioning-you just need to put the image into a div and alter to your liking your CSS file. For my page, I had used the width to tell the computer how big I wanted it. Then I put the image to "float" so that it wouldn't be all the way against the screen, but around the inside of each border per hardware. </p>
    <li>Choosing a Background Color</li>
    <p>Finally, we have choosing a background color. Choosing a backgrpund color was the simplest for me to code but the hardest to choose from. Reason being, is that there are so many colors that I liked but none that matched. However, that was just a self-made problem. I had gone onto Google and looked up color tags for HTML and copied and pasted the number code that I later on inputted into the CSS file. To have a background color, you just go to your CSS file and type in 'html' to your div. After writing html, enter a new line where you can format your entire html file. For background colors, specifically, you type in 'background-color:' and enter in the number code of the certain color with a hashtag (#) in the beginning of the number. Simple as that. </p>
